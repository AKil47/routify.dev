# Routify 3 BETA

We are so excited to announce that the R3 BETA is finally here! Jake has been going insane on the codebase, and has implemented so many new features, and keeping all the old favourites too. The V3 beta site can be checked out [here](https://v3.routify.dev/) or by using the version switcher in the top left.

> Do note that R3 is in beta and there is still a lot missing and not final, we do however have some WIP docs coming soon for everyone to see what's going on!

# Svelte Radio

For those who don't know, [Svelte Radio](https://www.svelteradio.com/) is an amazing podcast run by [Kev](https://github.com/kevmodrome), [Shawn](https://github.com/sw-yx), and [Antony](https://github.com/antony). We featured in a episode recently and talked all about Routify 3 amongst other things, it's really worth a listen. You should check it out [here](https://share.transistor.fm/s/10aa305c)!
