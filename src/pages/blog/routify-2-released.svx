## Improvements
- TabTransitions now automatically detects width of parent element. This gets rid of the previously required boilerplate.
- Page and layouts are now loaded in parallel to avoid waterfalls.
- The routes index, `routes.js` has been reduced 50-75% in size. For routify.dev with 60+ pages and a lot of custom metadata, `routes.js` clocks in at about 3 kb in production.
- To simplify navigation generation, node iteration now automatically skips dynamic pages and `index.svelte` files. To override automatic skipping, a metadata index can be assigned.

## New features
### Accessible components
Page and layout components can be accessed through the API. This allows for inlining pages on a single page.

```html
<!-- Inline all pages in a single page -->
<ul>
  {#each $layout.children as node}
    <li>
      <h3>{node.title}</h3>
      {#await node.component then cmp}
        <svelte:component this={cmp} />
      {/await}
    </li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```
### Metadata flags
 `<!-- routify:options someOption -->` now translates to `<!-- routify:options someOption=true -->`. Before you had to specify a value manually.

### Metadata options
  - `query-params-is-page` reload the component if a query parameter changes
  - `param-is-page` reload the component if the slug changes
  - `preload="proximity"` setting preload to proximity will preload the component if it's referenced in a `$url` helper. The preload setting is recursive, so enabling proximity preloading in the root layout will enable it on all pages.


### Hash based routing

Hash based routing has been on of the most requested features for Routify and now it's finally here.

To enable, set `useHash` to true in the runtime config.

```html
<Router config={{useHash: true}}>
```
_The runtime config is passed to the Router component, typically found in `App.svelte`_

### New `use` directive for `$url` helper

The `$url` helper can now be used as both a function and a `use` directive.


```javascript
/**function*/
<a href={$url('./movies')}>Movies</a>

/**directive*/
<a href="./movies" use:$url>Movies</a>

/**function with parameters*/
<a href={$url('./movies/:id', {id: 123})}>Some movie</a>

/**directive with parameters*/
<a href="./movies/:id" use:$url={{id: 123}}>Some movie</a>
```

### urlTransform

`urlTransform` replaces `basepath`. It requires a little more code, but provides much more control and versatility. For more information, see [runtime config](/docs/config/runtime).

### _folder.svelte
an alias for _layout.svelte. Will become the default.

---
## Changes
- Metadata is now parsed as JSON instead of evaluated as JS
- Npm namespace has changed from `@sveltech/routify` to `@roxi/routify`
- `basepath` replaced by `urltransform`
- `$layout` now refers to closest layout, not current component

Please refer to the [migration guide](/guide/migrating-from-1x) for upgrading a project.

---
## Starter template
The starter template got an overhaul and `rollup.config.js` has been unified and simplified. To handle static exports, Routify's built-in export function has been replaced with our own [spank](https://github.com/roxiness/spank).

The `scripts` folder has been replaced by an `api` folder which for now only handles SSR for Vercel. The folder can safely be deleted if you're not using Vercel with SSR.
